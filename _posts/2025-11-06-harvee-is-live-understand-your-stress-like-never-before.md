You know that feeling when everything seems fine… until it isn't?

You're powering through deadlines, your third coffee's cooling beside you, and suddenly your body taps you on the shoulder and says, "Hey, remember me?"

That's stress - the kind that doesn't shout, it whispers.

And most of us don't hear it until it's too late.

That's exactly why we built Harvee.

## Your Body's Speaking. Harvee Translates.

Your body speaks in data: heart rate variability, sleep quality, recovery, caffeine intake, daylight exposure. But most of us don't speak that language fluently.

Harvee does.

It reads your body's hidden stress patterns and turns them into something you can actually understand and act on.

Here's how Harvee helps you read between the beats.

## See What Stress Really Looks Like

Stress isn't just mental. Feelings are only part of the story. It's equally physiological, baked into your heart rhythm, your recovery time, and even the way you breathe. Harvee tracks those patterns and makes them visible:

- Daily body stress levels show what's really happening beneath the surface.
- Heat maps highlight your calmest and most stressful hours.
- HRV trends predict when you need rest or when you're ready to push harder.
- Plain-language insights explain what your data means in human terms.

No jargon. No "wellness score" you can't interpret. No "real time stress" when don't even wear your Apple Watch. Just real context about how your body's been doing.

## Guidance You Can Actually Use

Numbers are only useful if they help you make better choices.

Harvee doesn't just track, itguides you and highlights the most important.

- Smart activity recommendations tell you when to rest or move.
- Balance tracking shows how sleep, exercise, and mindfulness interact.
- Personalized insights turn your body signals into meaningful stories.
- A growing knowledge library helps you understand the "why" behind your metrics.

It's not about doing more. It's about doing what matters most for your recovery and resilience.

## Evidence-Based, Not Alarmist

Harvee is built on science, not scare tactics. We know how easily health tracking can slide into health anxiety.

So we designed Harvee to do the opposite.

- It explains, not warns.
- It guides, not guilt-trips.
- It helps you notice patterns before they become problems.

Stress isn't your enemy. It's a signal. Harvee helps you learn from it instead of running from it.

## Track What Actually Matters

Harvee connects with Apple Health to bring your key signals together in one clear view:

- Sleep quality and recovery
- Exercise, steps, and active calories
- Mindfulness and time in daylight
- Lifestyle factors: caffeine, alcohol, hydration
- Stand hours and movement patterns
- Heart rate variability (HRV)

You don't need to be a biohacker to understand your body, you just need better translation.

## Build Resilience, Not Anxiety

Most health apps make you feel behind. Harvee helps you feel informed.

You'll start noticing how your habits, recovery, and stress interact and begin making small, confident choices that add up to real resilience.

You'll understand when your body needs rest. When it's ready to perform. And when it's quietly saying, "I'm running low."

Because stress isn't something to eliminate. It's something to manage wisely.

## Privacy That Actually Means Privacy

Your health data stays yours.

Harvee doesn't store your personal health information. Ever.

We think that's just common sense and basic respect.
