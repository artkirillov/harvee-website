## A

### Acute Stress

Short-term stress caused by a specific event (meeting, workout, argument, deadline).

**Why it matters:** Acute stress is normal. Problems arise when it doesn't resolve.

**Reference:** [McEwen, 1998](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9428819/)

### Accentuated Antagonism

A physiological effect where parasympathetic (vagal) signals have a stronger impact when sympathetic activity is already present.

**Why it matters:** Explains why vagal "braking" after stress or exercise can be powerful even when the body is still activated.

**Reference:** [Shaffer & Ginsberg, 2017](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5624990/)

### Allostatic Load

The cumulative "wear and tear" on the body from repeated or chronic stress.

**Why it matters:** Sustained low HRV often reflects high allostatic load, not a single bad day.

**Reference:** [McEwen & Stellar, 1993](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8379800/)

### Approximate Entropy (ApEn)

A non-linear HRV metric that measures how predictable or regular heart rhythm patterns are. Lower values suggest more rigid physiology; higher values suggest more complexity.

**Limitation:** Sensitive to data length and noise, which is why it's used less today.

### Artifact

Any error in heart rhythm data caused by movement, poor sensor contact, missed beats, or electrical noise.

**Why it matters:** Even a single artifact can dramatically distort HRV metrics if not corrected.

### Autonomic Nervous System (ANS)

The system that regulates automatic body functions like heart rate, digestion, and breathing. It includes:

- **Parasympathetic branch** (rest and recovery)
- **Sympathetic branch** (activation and stress)

**Why it matters:** HRV reflects how flexible and balanced the ANS is.

**Reference:** [Shaffer & Ginsberg, 2017](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5624990/)

---

## B

### Baroreflex

A fast feedback system that adjusts heart rate in response to blood pressure changes.

**Why it matters:** One of the main drivers of resting HRV—often more influential than stress itself.

**Reference:** [La Rovere et al., 2008](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18426445/)

### Baroreflex Sensitivity (BRS)

A measure of how strongly heart rate responds to changes in blood pressure. Higher sensitivity generally reflects better cardiovascular adaptability.

**Why it matters:** A **major driver of resting HRV**, often misattributed to "vagal tone."

### Baseline HRV

Your typical HRV level when measured under consistent conditions (usually mornings at rest).

**Important:** Baselines are individual. Comparisons between people are often meaningless.

**Why it matters:** HRV must be interpreted relative to your own baseline, not population averages.

**Reference:** [Plews et al., 2017](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28290720/)

---

## C

### Chaos (Physiological)

Healthy biological systems show controlled irregularity, not perfect order. HRV reflects this "organized chaos." Too little or too much chaos can both signal dysfunction.

### Correlation Dimension (D2)

A non-linear metric estimating how many variables influence heart rhythm dynamics. Higher values suggest greater physiological complexity.

### Chronic Stress

Stress that persists without sufficient recovery.

**Why it matters:** Chronic stress is associated with prolonged HRV suppression.

**Reference:** [Thayer et al., 2012](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22178086/)

### Circadian Rhythm

Your body's internal 24-hour clock.

**Why it matters:** HRV follows circadian patterns, which is why morning measurements are more reliable.

**Reference:** [Portaluppi et al., 2012](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21641838/)

---

## D

### Data Fatigue

Mental exhaustion caused by excessive health data and alerts.

**Why it matters:** Over-monitoring can increase stress and reduce motivation.

**Reference:** Owens et al., 2018

### Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA α1 / α2)

Non-linear metrics describing short-term (α1) and long-term (α2) correlations in HRV. Used in fatigue, endurance, and overtraining research.

**Reference:** [Peng et al., 1995](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11538314/)

### Dynamic Autonomic Relationship

The parasympathetic and sympathetic systems do not work like a seesaw. They can increase together, suppress each other, or act independently.

**This is why simple "balance scores" are misleading.**

---

## E

### ECG (Electrocardiogram)

A method that measures the heart's electrical activity directly.

**Why it matters:** ECG is the gold standard for HRV measurement.

**Reference:** [Task Force of the ESC, 1996](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8598068/)

### Electrodermal Activity (EDA)

Often used in high-end wearables (like Fitbit or Oura) to measure "stress" via skin conductance.

**Why it matters:** Reflects sympathetic arousal but is highly context- and sweat-dependent; not a direct 'stress score.'

### Emergent Property

HRV is not produced by one organ or pathway. It emerges from interactions between the heart, brain, lungs, hormones, and blood vessels.

---

## F

### Frequency-Domain HRV

HRV analysis that looks at how heart rhythm variability is distributed across frequency bands. Useful, but easy to misinterpret without strict measurement conditions.

**Reference:** [Shaffer & Ginsberg, 2017](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5624990/)

---

## H

### HF Band (High Frequency, 0.15–0.40 Hz)

Reflects fast heart rhythm oscillations, strongly influenced by breathing. Often associated with parasympathetic modulation—but not a direct vagal meter.

### HF Power

The amount of variability in the HF band. Highly sensitive to breathing rate and posture.

**What it reflects:** Parasympathetic (vagal) modulation linked to respiration.

**Reference:** [Grossman & Taylor, 2007](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17081672/)

### HR Max − HR Min

Difference between highest and lowest heart rate during a breathing cycle. Reflects respiratory sinus arrhythmia, not vagal tone directly.

### Heart Rate (HR)

The number of heartbeats per minute.

**Why it matters:** Heart rate alone does not reflect stress or recovery quality.

**Reference:** [Billman, 2011](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22144961/)

### Heart Rate Variability (HRV)

The variation in time between consecutive heartbeats.

**Why it matters:** HRV reflects how well the body adapts to stress and recovers.

**Reference:** [Task Force of the ESC, 1996](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8598068/)

### HRV Biofeedback

A training technique that uses real-time feedback (visual, auditory, or tactile) to help a person increase their heart rate variability, typically through paced breathing at their resonance frequency (~0.1 Hz or 5–6 breaths per minute).

**Why it matters:** HRV biofeedback is used to improve autonomic regulation, reduce stress, enhance emotional control, and support recovery.

**Reference:** [Lehrer & Gevirtz, 2014](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25101026/)

### HRV Triangular Index (HTI)

A geometric HRV metric based on the distribution of RR intervals over time. Total number of RR intervals divided by the height of their histogram. Mostly used in long-term recordings.

**Reference:** [Task Force, 1996](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8598068/)

---

## I

### Interbeat Interval (IBI / RR Interval)

The time between consecutive heartbeats. All HRV metrics are derived from these intervals.

### Interoception

The ability to sense internal bodily signals.

**Why it matters:** Excessive reliance on data can reduce trust in bodily awareness.

**Reference:** [Mehling et al., 2012](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23133619/)

---

## L

### LF Band (Low Frequency, 0.04–0.15 Hz)

Represents slower oscillations influenced by baroreflex and breathing.

**Not a clean marker of sympathetic activity.**

### LF Peak / HF Peak

The dominant frequency within the LF or HF band.

**Why it matters:** Indicates breathing rate or autonomic rhythm dominance.

### LF/HF Ratio

Often marketed as "autonomic balance" (between sympathetic and parasympathetic activity).

**In reality:** Only meaningful under tightly controlled lab conditions and often misleading in daily life.

**Current consensus:** Oversimplified and often misleading.

**Why many researchers avoid it:** Physiology does not support a clean "sympathovagal balance" interpretation.

**Reference:** [Billman, 2013](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23431279/)

### LnRMSSD / LnHF

Log-transformed HRV metrics used to stabilize statistical distributions. Natural logarithm of RMSSD.

**Why used:**
- Normalizes skewed data
- Easier trend analysis

**Common in:** Athlete monitoring.

**Reference:** [Plews et al., 2013](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23852425/)

### Long-Term HRV (24-Hour HRV)

HRV calculated from full-day ambulatory ECG recordings.

**Why it matters:** Considered the **clinical gold standard**.

**Key insight:** Same math, **different physiology** compared to short-term HRV.

### Loss of Complexity

A reduction in the natural variability and adaptability of physiological systems. Seen in aging, chronic disease, and prolonged stress.

### LF Power

The amount of variability in the LF band.

**What it reflects:** Mixed influences (baroreflex, autonomic modulation).

**Common misconception:** LF ≠ sympathetic activity.

**Reference:** [Goldstein et al., 2011](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21890520/)

---

## M

### Measurement Context

Everything surrounding how HRV is recorded: posture, breathing, time of day, movement, sensor type, and artifacts.

**Context determines meaning.**

### Mean RR

Average time between heartbeats.

**What it reflects:** Average heart rate.

**Note:** Not an HRV metric by itself.

### Measurement Noise

Random variation unrelated to real physiological change.

**Examples:** Poor sensor contact, irregular breathing, movement.

**Why it matters:** Explains many sudden HRV drops.

### Measurement Non-Interchangeability

The principle that HRV values from different recording lengths cannot be directly compared.

**Why it matters:** Explains why your sleep HRV, morning HRV, and all-day HRV tell different stories.

### Morning HRV

HRV measured shortly after waking, before daily stressors. Best single snapshot for tracking trends over time.

**Why it matters:** It minimizes noise from movement, food, and daily stress.

**Reference:** [Plews et al., 2017](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28290720/)

---

## N

### NN50

An HRV metric that counts the number of successive RR pairs differing by more than 50 ms.

**What it reflects:** Parasympathetic activity.

**Limitation:** Sensitive to heart rate and recording length.

### Non-Linear HRV Metrics

Metrics that capture complexity and unpredictability rather than magnitude alone. Examples: SD1, SD2, SampEn, DFA.

### Nocebo Effect

Negative outcomes caused by negative expectations.

**Why it matters:** Health warnings can increase perceived stress.

**Reference:** [Barsky et al., 2002](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12020326/)

### Normal Units (nu)

Relative power of LF or HF normalized against LF+HF.

**Why it matters:** Allows comparison between people with different absolute HRV levels.

---

## P

### Parasympathetic Nervous System (PNS)

The branch of the ANS responsible for recovery, digestion, and calming. Acts quickly—within milliseconds.

**Why it matters:** Higher resting parasympathetic activity is associated with higher HRV.

**Reference:** [Thayer et al., 2010](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19910061/)

### Parasympathetic Rebound

An increase in parasympathetic activity following intense stress or exertion. Explains high HRV during sleep after hard days.

### Poincaré Plot

A visual plot of each RR interval against the previous one. Used to derive SD1 and SD2:

- **SD1:** Short-term variability (≈ RMSSD)
- **SD2:** Long-term variability

**Why it matters:** Visual and intuitive representation of HRV structure.

**Reference:** [Tulppo et al., 1996](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8795444/)

### Paced Breathing

Controlled breathing used in HRV biofeedback. Can artificially inflate HRV if used during measurement.

### PPG (Photoplethysmography)

Optical method used by smartwatches to estimate heart activity.

**Why it matters:** Convenient but more sensitive to motion artifacts than ECG.

**Reference:** [Charlton et al., 2018](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5964362/)

### pNN50

Percentage of NN50 relative to total intervals.

**Why it's rare now:** Less reliable than RMSSD for short recordings.

---

## R

### RR Interval (NN Interval)

The time (in milliseconds) between two consecutive heartbeats.

**Why it matters:** All HRV metrics are derived from RR intervals.

### Recovery

The process of returning to baseline after stress.

**Why it matters:** Recovery capacity matters more than avoiding stress.

### Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia (RSA)

Heart rate speeding up during inhalation and slowing during exhalation.

**Why it matters:** A major contributor to short-term HRV.

**Reference:** [Grossman & Taylor, 2007](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17081672/)

### Respiratory Rate

Often derived from the same PPG signal as HRV and used as a key component of "Recovery" or "Readiness" scores.

**Why it matters:** Elevated resting respiratory rate can indicate strain or illness even when HRV seems normal.

### RMSSD (Root Mean Square of Successive Differences)

Square root of the mean squared differences between successive RR intervals. The most commonly used HRV metric in wearables.

**What it reflects:** Primarily parasympathetic (vagal) modulation. Reflects short-term variability and parasympathetic modulation.

**Why it matters:**
- Most robust for short recordings
- Least affected by breathing variability
- Gold standard for daily HRV tracking

**Used by:** Most modern HRV apps and wearables.

**Reference:** [Shaffer & Ginsberg, 2017](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5624990/); [Plews et al., 2017](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28290720/)

---

## S

### Sample Entropy (SampEn)

A refined version of Approximate Entropy. Measures signal complexity with less sensitivity to noise.

**Why it matters:** Lower entropy = more rigid system.

**Reference:** [Richman & Moorman, 2000](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10843903/)

### SD1 / SD2

Non-linear HRV metrics derived from the Poincaré plot.

- **SD1:** Short-term variability (directly related to RMSSD)
- **SD2:** Longer-term variability

### SDNN (Standard Deviation of NN Intervals)

Standard deviation of all RR intervals in a recording.

**What it reflects:** Overall HRV (both sympathetic and parasympathetic influences).

**Used in:**
- Long recordings (≥5 min, 24h Holter)
- Clinical and epidemiological studies

**Limitations:**
- Strongly influenced by recording length
- Not ideal for short daily measurements

**Reference:** [Task Force of the ESC, 1996](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8598068/)

### Short-Term HRV (ST-HRV)

HRV calculated from ~5-minute recordings, usually at rest.

**Why it matters:** This is what most morning readiness and stress measurements are based on.

**Key insight:** ST-HRV reflects **parasympathetic activity and baroreflex**, not "overall autonomic balance."

### SDSD

Standard deviation of successive RR differences.

**What it reflects:** Similar to RMSSD.

**Why it's less used:** RMSSD is mathematically more stable.

### Sleep Quality

A combination of duration, continuity, and structure of sleep.

**Why it matters:** Poor sleep strongly suppresses HRV.

**Reference:** [Krause et al., 2017](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28515433/)

### Stress

A physiological state involving nervous, hormonal, and cardiovascular responses. The body's response to perceived demand.

**Why it matters:** Stress is not inherently harmful; unresolved stress is.

**Reference:** [McEwen, 1998](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9428819/)

### Sympathetic Nervous System (SNS)

The branch of the ANS responsible for activation, alertness, and energy mobilization.

**Why it matters:** Dominance of sympathetic activity is associated with lower HRV.

---

## T

### Total Power

Sum of HRV energy across frequency bands.

**What it reflects:** Overall autonomic activity, not readiness.

### Trend

The direction of change over time.

**Why it matters:** Trends matter far more than daily values.

### Time-Domain HRV

HRV metrics calculated directly from beat-to-beat intervals (e.g., RMSSD).

**Why it matters:** Most practical and reliable for daily tracking.

**Reference:** [Task Force of the ESC, 1996](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8598068/)

### TINN

Triangular Interpolation of the NN Interval Histogram. A geometric HRV metric robust to noise.

**Why it's rare:** Requires large datasets.

---

## U

### Ultra-Short-Term HRV (<5 minutes)

HRV estimated from very brief recordings (10–60 seconds). Convenient but less reliable and not interchangeable with longer measures.

**Why it matters:** Common in wearables and controversial.

**Key insight:** UST-HRV is **not interchangeable** with 5-min or 24-h HRV.

### ULF Band

Ultra-low-frequency HRV components seen only in 24-hour recordings.

---

## V

### Vagal Modulation

Influence of the vagus nerve on heart rate patterns. HRV is a proxy for this under controlled conditions—not a direct measurement.

### Vagal Tone

The influence of the vagus nerve on heart activity.

**Why it matters:** HRV reflects vagal modulation but is not identical to vagal tone.

**Reference:** [Laborde et al., 2017](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28265249/)

### Vagus Nerve

A major nerve connecting the brain to the heart and organs.

**Why it matters:** Primary pathway for heart-brain communication, particularly for parasympathetic regulation.

### VLF Band

Very-low-frequency oscillations influenced by hormones, thermoregulation, and circadian rhythms.

---

## W

### Wearables

Consumer technology that measures physiological signals. Accuracy depends on context, algorithms, and data handling.

**Why it matters:** Wearables provide trends, not diagnoses.

---

## Z

### Z-Scores / Normalized HRV

HRV expressed relative to personal baseline.

**Why it matters:** Improves interpretability across individuals.
